- FIPS / Regulation

# Testbeds

- [ ] yolotls_client - utility knife for client side operations
- [ ] yolotls_server - utility knife for serving side operations
- [ ] yaws Integration demonstrating wasm32-wasi w/ WebRTC (DTLS) + h1/2specs + QUIC
- [ ] e-mail server / client integration

## Run

Lunatic Flavor:

$ `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg yaws_flavor=\"lunatic\"" cargo run --bin yolotls_client --target wasm32-wasi`

io_uring Flavor:

$ `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg yaws_flavor=\"io_uring\"" cargo run --bin yolotls_client`

## yaws Library

yoloTLS has non-exclusive options
